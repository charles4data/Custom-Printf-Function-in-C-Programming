# Custom-Printf-Function-in-C-Programming

Here, I showcase the steps, skills, and practice in creating a custom printf function, in line with the provisions and requirements of ALX-SE. I will handle numerous things in this case, including specifiers, flags, etc.

-----------------
## Format Specifiers

The function will be able to handle a variety of format specifiers such as:
+ %d or %i for integers.
+ %f for floating-point numbers.
+ %c for characters.
+ %s for strings.
+ %x and %X for hexadecimal numbers.
+ %o for octal numbers.
+ %u for unsigned integers.
+ %p for pointers.
+ %e and %E for scientific notation.
+ %g and %G for compact notation.
+ %n to write the number of characters written so far into an integer pointer.
+ %% to print a literal '%' character.

---------------------
## Flags

The flag will be able to handle the following flags:
+ Left-justify.
+ Sign.
+ Zero-padding.
+ Alternate form.

--------------------------------
## Width and Precision

The function will be capable of handling and addressing the following:
+ Field width.
+ Precision.

-----------------
## Modifiers

The following modifiers are also integrated into this function:
+ h for short integer.
+ l for long integer.
+ ll for long long integer.
+ L for long double.

------------------
## Error Handling

The function will have the capacity to handle incorrect format specifiers or invalid combinations gracefully.
